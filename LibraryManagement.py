Question 2 - Library Management System

Defines a Book Class with title, author, num_pages, availability, and a Library Class
that manages a list of books with add, remove, check out, check in, and print 
operations.
Includes a test script that exercises all methods and prints the outcomes.

Emojis and separators were included to make the output more visual and improve 
readability.
